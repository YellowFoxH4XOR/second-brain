This detailed, day-by-day plan is designed for a motivated beginner with existing Python programming knowledge. It synthesizes recommendations from top-tier university courses, industry-standard books, and popular free online resources. The schedule is structured for approximately 2-3 hours of focused study per day.

**Primary Book Reference:** Throughout this plan, the primary text will be **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron**. It is highly recommended to acquire this book as it provides the depth and practical code that online videos often skim over[1][2].
