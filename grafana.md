Product Requirements Document: GenAI-Powered Root-Cause Analysis (RCA) in Grafana
Author: Gemini
Version: 1.0
Date: July 5, 2025
Status: Draft

1. Introduction & Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for a new feature that integrates Generative AI (GenAI) into our monitoring stack to automate Root-Cause Analysis (RCA). Today, our engineering teams rely on a robust Grafana setup with Prometheus and Loki, but incident response remains a manual, time-consuming process. Engineers must manually sift through metrics and logs to diagnose alerts, leading to high cognitive load and extended Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).

This feature introduces a GenAI service that automatically analyzes alert data, determines the root cause, and presents a human-readable summary directly within a Grafana dashboard. By embedding intelligence into our existing observability platform, we aim to drastically reduce MTTR, streamline incident response, and free up engineering time for high-value work.

2. Problem Statement
When a critical alert fires, our on-call engineers are under immense pressure to find the root cause quickly. The current workflow involves:

High MTTR: Engineers spend tens of minutes, or even hours, manually correlating metrics from Prometheus with logs from Loki across multiple dashboards and terminals.

Context Switching: The need to jump between different tools and data sources is inefficient and increases the risk of human error.

Expert Dependency: Diagnosing complex issues often requires senior engineers, creating bottlenecks and delaying resolution if they are unavailable.

Tedious Reporting: Creating post-incident reports is a manual, after-the-fact process that is often inconsistent and time-consuming.

This manual approach is inefficient, unscalable, and directly impacts service reliability and customer satisfaction.

3. Target Audience & User Personas
Priya, the Site Reliability Engineer (SRE): Priya is responsible for system uptime and performance. She needs to diagnose complex system failures quickly and accurately. She values tools that provide deep insights and reduce manual toil.

Raj, the On-Call Engineer: Raj responds to alerts, often at night or on weekends. He needs clear, actionable information delivered with the alert so he can resolve issues fast, even if he's not a deep expert on that specific service.

Anjali, the Engineering Manager: Anjali is responsible for team productivity and incident management processes. She needs to ensure incidents are resolved efficiently and that the team learns from them. She values automated reporting and metrics that track incident response performance.

4. Goals & Objectives
The primary goal of this feature is to reduce Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) by embedding automated RCA directly into the operator's workflow.

Objective 1: Reduce average MTTR for critical alerts by at least 40% within the first quarter of deployment.

Objective 2: Decrease the time spent on manual log/metric correlation during an incident by 75%.

Objective 3: Automate the generation of preliminary post-incident reports, making them available within 5 minutes of an incident's resolution.

Objective 4: Achieve a user satisfaction score of over 80% (measured via a feedback mechanism) from on-call engineers.

5. Functional Requirements (Features)
F1: Automated RCA Generation Service
A backend service that orchestrates the analysis.

F1.1: Must provide a secure webhook endpoint to receive alert notifications from Alertmanager.

F1.2: Upon receiving an alert, the service must query Prometheus for metrics and Loki for logs within a configurable time window (e.g., 15 minutes before and 5 minutes after the alert).

F1.3: The service will use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to process the collected data. This involves embedding the evidence in a vector store (PGVector, OpenSearch k-NN).

F1.4: The service will query a Large Language Model (e.g., Llama 3 hosted via Ollama) with a structured prompt to generate:

A concise summary of the likely root cause.

A "Five Whys" breakdown explaining the causal chain.

A list of recommended remediation steps.

The output must be formatted in clean, readable Markdown.

F2: Alert Enrichment
The service must write its findings back to the original alert.

F2.1: The service must use the Alertmanager API to PATCH the firing alert that triggered it.

F2.2: The generated Markdown RCA must be stored in a dedicated annotation field, e.g., annotations.rca_genai.

F3: Grafana Dashboard Integration
The RCA findings must be visible directly within Grafana.

F3.1: A new or modified Grafana dashboard will be created.

F3.2: The dashboard must include a Table panel configured to use the Alertmanager data source.

F3.3: This table must be configured to display the rca_genai annotation, rendering the Markdown content so operators can read the analysis alongside the alert's primary details.

F4: User Feedback Mechanism
A system to capture user feedback for future improvement.

F4.1: The Grafana Table panel will include "üëç" and "üëé" icons/links next to each AI-generated RCA.

F4.2: Clicking these icons will trigger a webhook or API call to a backend service.

F4.3: The feedback (positive/negative, alert ID, generated text) must be stored in a database for future analysis.

F5: Automated Post-Mortem Generation
A feature to streamline incident reporting.

F5.1: A "Generate Report" button will be available next to resolved alerts that had an associated RCA.

F5.2: Clicking this button will compile the alert details, key metrics, logs, user feedback, and the final GenAI analysis into a structured post-mortem document (e.g., Markdown or Confluence page).

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The end-to-end RCA generation (from webhook receipt to alert patch) must complete in under 3 minutes.

Scalability: The GenAI service must be able to process at least 20 concurrent alerts without significant performance degradation.

Reliability: The GenAI service and its components must have an uptime of >99.5%.

Security: All API communication must be secured via TLS. Secrets (API keys, DB credentials) must be stored in a secure vault, not in code.

7. End-to-End Flow (V1.0)
An event generates an alert in Prometheus.

Alertmanager calls the GenAI service webhook.

The GenAI service generates and patches the RCA annotation.

The operator views the RCA in Grafana and provides feedback.

The feedback is stored for future model improvement initiatives.

8. Success Metrics
Primary Metric: Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). We will measure the average time from alert firing to resolution before and after implementation.

Secondary Metrics:

Operator Feedback Score: Ratio of üëç to üëé clicks, indicating the quality of the current model's output.

Time to Post-Mortem: Time taken to generate and share incident reports.

Feature Adoption: Number of active users and teams utilizing the RCA dashboard panel.

9. Out of Scope for Version 1.0
Advanced Model Fine-Tuning: V1 will focus on collecting feedback data. A full fine-tuning training pipeline is out of scope.

Automated Remediation: The system will suggest fixes but will not execute any actions (e.g., restarting a pod, rolling back a deployment).

External UI: All user interaction will occur within Grafana. No separate, standalone workbench will be built.

Broad Data Source Support: Initial support is limited to Prometheus and Loki. Other sources like Jaeger traces or different logging systems are not included in V1.
